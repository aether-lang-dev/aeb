# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **`lib/aether`: extern link-failure diagnostic hint** (Option B from
  `asks/transitive-regen-extern-followup.md`). When gcc fails with
  `undefined reference to <sym>` during a manual aether.program link,
  aeb now scans every `module_generated.c` under the workspace root,
  groups any symbols that resolve to sibling Aether modules, and emits
  a `regen_with("<path>", "<caps>")` hint line per defining sibling.
  Symbols that don't resolve to a project module (libc, runtime libs)
  produce no hint — true C externs aren't false-flagged. Covered by
  `tests/test_aether_extern_diagnostics.ae`.
